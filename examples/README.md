# SwellDB Examples
This folder contains example notebooks demonstrating the capabilities of SwellDB. Each notebook showcases 
a different use case or feature of the system, providing a hands-on experience with the technology.

## Get Started
### Install SwellDB

```bash
pip install swelldb
```

### Obtain API keys
These examples are mainly using the OpenAI API, and some of them also use the Serper API. You can sign up for OpenAI [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and for Serper [here](https://serper.dev/). Then
you can set the API keys as environment variables before running the notebooks:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
export SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
```
